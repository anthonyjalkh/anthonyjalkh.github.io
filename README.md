This repository holds random samples of my personal notes and exploratory projects in physics and mathematics. It's not formal scientific research but a way for me to both gauge my learning progress over time, and have unrestricted access to very concise summaries of some of my older notes, largely from undergrad.

More advanced unpublished or professional work is stored privately in my personal vaults.

I exclusively upload here whenever I feel like it, as it mainly serves as a fun and engaging way to familiarize myself with the powerful Git+Overleaf workflow or even the newly released typesetting system, Typst. Therefore, the repository linked to this website serves as an experimentation tool that enables me to effectively enhance my actual professional work such as more advanced derivations, papers or reports that I store locally.

Feel free to browse, and please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you find any mistakes or have suggestions.
