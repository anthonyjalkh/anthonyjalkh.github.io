# anthonyjalkh.github.io

This repository holds my personal notes and exploratory projects in physics and mathematics.
It's not formal scientific research but a way for me to both gauge my learning progress over time, and have unrestricted access to my older notes.

More advanced unpublished or professional work is stored privately in my personal vaults.

I exclusively upload here whenever I feel like it, as it mainly serves as a fun and engaging way to familiarize myself with the powerful Git+Overleaf workflow. This repository serves as an experimenting tool that enables me to effectively enhance my actual professional work such as more advanced derivations, papers or reports.

Feel free to browse, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you find any mistakes or have suggestions.
